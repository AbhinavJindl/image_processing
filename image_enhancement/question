Implement the image enhancement operations/methods (including affine transformations, gray level transformations, histogram processing, filters, histogram processing, adaptive histogram equalization, etc. ).
The Assignment to be done individually and not in groups.
Image enhancement operations/methods that need to be implemented:
·Image Resize (Corresponding Matlab command ==> L = imresize(I,1.5,'bilinear'); where is the Input Image matrix)
·Other Affine Transformations including rotation, translation etc.
·Image negatives
·Log transformations
·Power-law/Gamma Transformations
·Piecewise linear transformation functions
·Bitplane slicing
·Image reconstruction given some tie points
·Histogram equalization
·Adaptive histogram equalization
·Histogram matching
(As far as intensity values computation using interpolation is concerned, you are expected to have option for both nearest neighborhood and bilinear)

Program
Programming language – C/C++ and you may use openCV for reading/writing images but you are not allowed to use inbuilt operations /direct-functionalities for these taksk. Later compare the results of your functions with the results obtained using OpenCV library functionalities for these operations. For such comparison, you may report RMSE / PSNR.


There should be only one .cpp file (and not multiple .cpp files)
Filename shall be in the format as follows: a2_<Name>_<rollno>.cpp (For e.g. a2_Ramesh_2016CSB1000.cpp ..)


Report:
There shall be one .doc or .pdf file showing the input image, outpage etc. corresponding to different image enhancement operations/methods. Also include the description of parameters chosen and any specific observations made. You may include atmost two example input figures (and their corresponding output images and/or graphs) for one operation.
For methods for which the output could be computed using inbuilt OpenCV library functions, mention that inbuilt OpenCV library function, show the corresponding output and also include RMSE.
Filename shall again be in format as follows: A2_<Name>_<rollno>.doc or .docx or .pdf (.odt Not allowed)
Include a README.txt mentioning in brief steps for running your program and any other comments from your side.
Final submission should be just one file in the .tar.gz format as follows: a2_<Name>_<rollno>.tar.gz (or .tgz)
More details (if needed) would be shared soon. Feel free to let me know if you need any further clarification.
Unless you state otherwise, it is implicitly assumed that you coded yourself without any help from your friends/colleagues/relatives/superiors/online-resources. If you take some help, you must mention that explicitly in READMe and as well as in your C-code comments. Plagiarism related polices as per Institute rules will be applicable.
Its quite a bit of work. So get going. 
Deadline to submit: 6th Feb Tuesday 23:59pm

There is penalty for late submission: -2% for each 1 hour late.
There is reward for early submissions : + 2 % for each 24 hours earlier. (Max 10% reward)
